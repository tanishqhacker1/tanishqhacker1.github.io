3. Add Your Google Verification File

Suppose Google gave you a file named google123abc456def.html with the contents:

You would add this file at the root of your repo:

    Be sure to use your real verification file name and content.

4. Enable GitHub Pages

    Go to your repository's Settings â†’ Pages
    Source: Branch main / (root)
    Save

Your site will be live at:

You (and Google) can now visit:

to see the verification file.
5. Complete Google Search Console Verification

    Go to Google Search Console
    Add your site: https://tanishqhacker1.github.io
    Choose the "HTML file" verification method
    Google will check for your file and verify your site

If you give me your actual Google HTML filename and content, I can generate the exact file block for you to copy-paste!
